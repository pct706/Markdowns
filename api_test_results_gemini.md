**Question:** Calculate the average time between DownCategory changes for 'AMS-MCV-700N5'.

**Response:** The query was designed to figure out the average time between downtime category changes for the machine 'AMS-MCV-700N5'.  Unfortunately, the results show that there's no data available to calculate this average.  There were no downtime category changes recorded for this machine that met the query's criteria.

## Test #48

**Question:** Calculate the trend of PDT time for 'HAAS-VF2-2' over the past 6 months by week.

**Response:** The data shows the average PDT (presumably Production Down Time) for machine 'HAAS-VF2-2' over the past six months, broken down by week.  The average PDT for each week shown was 0.0.

Here's a table summarizing the results:

| Week      | Average PDT |
|-----------|-------------|
| 2024-06-23 | 0.0         |
| 2024-06-24 | 0.0         |
| 2024-06-25 | 0.0         |
| 2024-06-26 | 0.0         |
| 2024-07-27 | 0.0         |
| 2024-07-28 | 0.0         |
| 2024-07-29 | 0.0         |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.0         |


This indicates that there was no production downtime recorded for the machine during those weeks.  It's important to investigate why no PDT was recorded;  it could indicate a data entry issue or that the machine was not operational during those weeks.

========================================================================================================================

```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-%W', PDate) AS week, AVG(PDT) AS avg_pdt FROM ShiftProductionDetails WHERE CompanyID LIKE 'Auto CNC' AND MachineID LIKE 'HAAS-VF2-2' AND PDate > strftime('%Y-%m-%d', date('now', '-6 months')) GROUP BY week ORDER BY week
